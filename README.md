Data mining is the process of extracting and discovering patterns and trends in large datasets. It involves using advanced techniques and algorithms to identify and analyze data in order to gain insights and support decision-making. Cluster analysis, also known as clustering, is a common data mining technique that involves grouping data into clusters based on similarities or common characteristics. This technique is useful for exploratory data analysis and for identifying patterns and relationships in the data.

In this project, we will be using data mining and cluster analysis to analyze a large dataset and identify patterns and trends within the data. We will apply various techniques and algorithms to extract useful information from the data, and use this information to gain insights and make predictions. By applying data mining and cluster analysis, we hope to gain a better understanding of the data and be able to make more informed decisions
