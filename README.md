# Cluster Analysis

 **Data mining** is the process of extracting and discovering patterns and trends in large datasets. It involves using advanced techniques and algorithms to identify and analyze data in order to gain insights and support decision-making. **Cluster analysis**, also known as clustering, is a common data mining technique that involves grouping data into clusters based on similarities or common characteristics. This technique is useful for exploratory data analysis and for identifying patterns and relationships in the data.

   In this project, we will be using data mining and cluster analysis to analyze a large dataset and identify patterns and trends within the data. We will apply various techniques and algorithms to extract useful information from the data, and use this information to gain insights and make predictions. By applying data mining and cluster analysis, we hope to gain a better understanding of the data and be able to make more informed decisions. Business question for the project: ***“How can our company effectively target strategies to improve employee satisfaction to specific groups of employees based on their characteristics and performance?”***
   
   Variables use for the analysis are:
* **Age**: Age of employee in years
* **MonthlyIncome**: How much the employee earns per month
* **PercentSalaryHike**: The percentage increase in salary over two years
* **YearsAtCompany**: The total number of years the employee has been with the company

# k-means cluster analysis
We will be using the k-means clustering algorithm to identify and analyze patterns and trends in a dataset. K-means clustering is a popular and effective method for grouping data into clusters based on similarity. Using the R programming language to implement the k-means algorithm and analyze the data. R is a popular and powerful language for data analysis and visualization. By applying the k-means algorithm to our dataset, we hope to uncover valuable information and improve our understanding of the data.


        First part of the project is to conduct a k-means cluster analysis: 
         Part 2: Hierarchical Cluster Analysis
